Microsoft AdventureWorks Database Analysis and Visualization with PowerBI. It's sample database, I chose 'AdventureWorksLT2019.bak' and 'AdventureWorksLT2017.bak' data for analysis &amp; visualization. The query editing was done in 'Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio' and visualization part was using 'Microsoft Power BI'. Also for analysis I used MS Excel and PowerBI's query tool.
